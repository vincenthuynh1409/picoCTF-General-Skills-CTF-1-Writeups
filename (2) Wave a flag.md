### 💡 Solution:

So the problem provides us with a downloadable file, so we use the `wget [file]` command.

Hover your cursor over the file link, right click, copy link address, then use the `wget` command (below);

Now, we can see the "warm" file that we downloaded in our directory → use `ls` to see the contents of the directory (below);

So let's see what's inside the file. w

You can do this by using the `cat [file]` command to see the contents inside the "warm" file. 

Tyoe in `cat warm` into your terminal and press Enter.

Woah. There is alot of stuff in this file (below):

Looking at the hints, it says to use the `./warm` command to run the program (below):

But wait, it says "permission denied", meaning we do not have permission to execute this program.

However, according to the hint, you'll first have to make it executable with: `chmod +x warm`

>The `chmod` command ("change mode") is the utility used to modify file and directory permissions.
> - +: An operator that adds a specific permission.
> - x: Represents the execute permission

Great, now we can do `./warm` again!

Once the program runs, it says to pass `-h` into the program so we can just do that:

After, press Enter.

We should get the flag! (below);

So the **final flag** is: `picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_ac5832c}`! 🎉

> copy and paste (or manually type) the final flag into the submission area to complete the challenge.
